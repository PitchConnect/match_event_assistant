# Integration Plan: Communication Modules

## Objectives
- Integrate LLMClient and APIClient into the main match_event_assistant workflow.
- Ensure modularity and testability.

## Steps
1. Define clear interfaces for LLMClient and APIClient in the workflow.
2. Refactor workflow components to use these interfaces via dependency injection.
3. Develop integration tests to verify correct interaction and allow mocking.
4. Incrementally implement integration, validating at each stage.
5. Document integration points and update onboarding docs as needed.

## Next Actions
- Review workflow entry points for communication needs.
- Identify components to refactor for modularity.
- Draft initial integration test cases.
