This project enforces the following development workflow:

- All code changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs) targeting the main branch.
- Every PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one reviewer before merging.
- Pre-commit hooks (black, flake8, hygiene) must pass before commits are accepted.
- Continuous Integration (CI) checks (lint, test) must pass before merging.
- All contributors must use the provided development container for consistency.
- The workflow is subject to change; see CONTRIBUTING.md for details.
