# Project Workflow (auto-generated 2025-07-27)

This project enforces the following development workflow:

- All code changes must be submitted via Pull Requests (PRs) targeting the main branch.
- Every PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one reviewer before merging.
- Pre-commit hooks (black, flake8, hygiene) must pass before commits are accepted.
- Continuous Integration (CI) checks (lint, test) must pass before merging.
- All contributors must use the provided development container for consistency.
- The workflow is subject to change; see CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

## Issue and Milestone Management

- Regularly review all open issues (at least at the end of each milestone or sprint).
- Close issues that are resolved, obsolete, or no longer relevant.
- Update issue comments with a summary of actions taken before closing.
- Ensure milestones reflect current project priorities and are updated or closed as needed.
- All contributors and agents are responsible for maintaining issue hygiene as part of the workflow.
