## 2025-07-27 11:15:31 UTC – Process Gap: Reviewer Assignment and Code Review Protocol

No evidence was found of reviewers being assigned to changes, pull requests, or code reviews during Milestone Zero. Changes appear to have been committed directly, bypassing formal PR and review processes.

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Initiate retroactive review of all changes made during Milestone Zero.
2. Enforce a PR-based workflow with mandatory reviewer assignment for all future changes.
3. Automate reviewer assignment using GitHub settings or bots.

This protocol will be addressed for all future changes. All actions and decisions are logged in real time.
